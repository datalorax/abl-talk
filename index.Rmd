# Instructional groups

* SimGroup: Similar performance

--

* DivGroup: Diverse performance

--

* Random: Students groups randomly created

--

* Manual: Teachers create groupings

---
# Quizes

* 10 quizzes administered, each one week apart

* Instructional grouping changed for each quiz

* Scored on a percent correct basis

# RQs

> What groups of students, based on common attributes, are consistently underperforming on their quizzes?

<br>

> Are there any types of groups, e.g., manual groups vs calculated (SimGroup, DivGroup, Random), that you would recommend teachers use or avoid using?

# Primary takeaway

Amongst instructional groups, scores in the **Manual** were clearly the lowest


--
Race differences were modest, and generally washed out when accounting for instructional grouping


--
Gender differences were also modest, and generally washed out when accounting for instructional group

--

  + Some evidence **Male** students scored reliably below **Female** students, on average


--
**DivGroup** was clearly the highest performing instructional group, and should be preferred over all others

Benefits

* More comparabale across measures

* More comparable across studies

* Can help interpretation by comparing to historical trends

<!-- Hedges & Nowell (1999) found narrowing of Black/White and Hispanic/White achievement gaps through 70's and 80's, stable through 90's. "Given the rate of change over the past 30 yearsâ€¦ it would require more than 50 years to close the gap in mean reading achievement and a century or more to close the gap in mean mathematics and science achievement".  -->

<!-- More recent research (Reardon et al., 1990) found effect sizes in the same range as the 99 publication. -->

# Effect sizes
## Instructional Groups

```{r }
d %>% 
  coh_d(score ~ group_type) %>% 
  arrange(group_type_foc) %>% 
  mutate(abs = abs(coh_d)) %>% 
  distinct(abs, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  select(
    `Focal Group` = group_type_foc,
    `Reference Group` = group_type_ref,
    d = coh_d
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = "lcc", digits = 2)
```

# Effect sizes
## Race

```{r }
race_coh_d <- d %>% 
  coh_d(score ~ race) %>% 
  arrange(race_foc) %>% 
  mutate(abs = abs(coh_d)) %>% 
  distinct(abs, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  select(
    `Focal Group` = race_foc,
    `Reference Group` = race_ref,

# Quick sidebar: "Gap" language

# Mean differences

* In education, we often talk about "achievement gaps", implying mean differences


--
* There is [some evidence](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0013189X19863765) that this puts greater onus on students, rather than systems


--
* These **average** differences may also lead teachers to [have lower expectations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19083359/) for specific groups of students


--
But **mean differences** imply little for an **individual** student.

# Process

* First model students' growth only

--

* Then add in instructional group

--

* Compare fit of models


--

* Add *race*, compare, add *gender* compare


--
If the fit of the model improves, so does our model accuracy

---
# Growth vs Instructional groups

```{r }
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(weeks = quiz_number - 1)

m0 <- lmer(
  score ~ weeks + (1 | student_id),
  data = d,
  REML = FALSE
)

m1 <- lmer(
  score ~ weeks + group_type + (1 | student_id),
  data = d,
  REML = FALSE
)
as.data.frame(anova(m0, m1)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

Lower values indicate better fitting model


--
## Takeaway

Including instructional group *clearly* helps us explain why students get the scores they do

---
# Pairwise comparisons

<br>

```{r }
emm1 <- emmeans(m1, specs = pairwise ~ group_type)

confint(emm1$contrasts) %>% 
  select(
    Contrast = contrast,
    Estimate = estimate,
    `Lower Bound` = lower.CL,
    `Upper Bound` = upper.CL
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

---
# Add in Race

```{r }
m2 <- lmer(
  score ~ weeks + group_type + race + (1 | student_id),
  data = d,
  REML = FALSE
)
as.data.frame(anova(m1, m2)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

<br>

--
## Takeaway

We are not able to **better** explain why students scored the way they did by including *race*, after already accounting for their instructional group

---
# Pairwise race comparisons

```{r }
emm2 <- emmeans(m2, specs = pairwise ~ race)

confint(emm2$contrasts) %>% 
  select(
    Contrast = contrast,
    Estimate = estimate,
    `Lower Bound` = lower.CL,
    `Upper Bound` = upper.CL
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```


---
# Drop race, add gender

Comparison is to instructional group only (while still accounting for individual student growth)

```{r }
m3 <- lmer(
  score ~ weeks + group_type + gender + (1 | student_id),
  data = d,
  REML = FALSE
)
as.data.frame(anova(m1, m3)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

<br>

--
## Takeaway

Gender also does not help our explanation beyond what we already know from instructional group

---
# Pariwise comparisons

Some evidence of a reliable male/female difference

```{r }
emm3 <- emmeans(m3, specs = pairwise ~ gender)

confint(emm3$contrasts) %>% 
  select(
    Contrast = contrast,
    Estimate = estimate,
    `Lower Bound` = lower.CL,
    `Upper Bound` = upper.CL
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```


---
# Final takeaways

> What groups of students, based on common attributes, are consistently underperforming on their quizzes?


--
* Manual instructional grouping


--

* Little evidence that race is an important predictor

--

* Some evidence that Male students score lower than Female, on average


---
# Final takeaways

> Are there any types of groups, e.g., manual groups vs calculated (SimGroup, DivGroup, Random), that you would recommend teachers use or avoid using?

--

* **DivGroup** was consistently the highest performing


---
# Other possible areas to explore

* Could consider collapsing gender in some way

* Could explore interactions

  + It's possible, for example, that we could find greater gender or race differences *within* an instructional grouping

* Probably *should* do a few more robustness checks before making implementation decisions
